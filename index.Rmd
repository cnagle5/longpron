# Overview

**Statement of Purpose**
This webpage is periodically updated with new longitudinal L2 pronunciation research that does not have a pronunciation-specific intervention. On this page, you can see the types of longitudinal studies that have been conducted up to this point, focusing on longitudinal design choices, such as study length and data points, and their intersection with participant sample and measurement characteristics. This page accompanies and builds upon

Nagle, C. L. (2021). Assessing the state of the art in longitudinal L2 pronunciation research: Trends and future directions. *Journal of Second Language Pronunciation*.Advance online publication. http://doi.org/10.1075/jslp.20059.nag

**Researchers**
If you have published a longitudinal L2 pronunciation study that you think should be included in this webpage, please email me the citation so that I can review it and incorporate it if appropriate. Please note the following inclusion criteria: a study dealing with any aspect of L2 pronunciation learning that (1) tracked the same groups of participants over two or more data points, (2) did not include pronunciation-related training or a pronunciation-specific intervention, and (3) was published after 2006 in a peer-reviewed journal.

**Notes**
I have reconfigured the data set from the format published and analyzed in Nagle (2021). In the updated data set, I treat each sample as an individual entry, which means that research reports that include multiple samples have multiple entries. By treating each sample as an individual entry in the data set, we can see how many unique longitudinal samples have been collected, including samples that were included in the same research report. 

Research reports may have multiple samples for any of the following reasons: (1) L1 background, (2) age range, (3) context of learning. The "Multiple Entry" variable allows the data to be subset to exclude multiple entries to avoid double counting studies for certain tabulations, such as study length, data points, and so on.
